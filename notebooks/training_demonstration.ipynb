## Training Demonstration

This notebook demonstrates how to train and evaluate the logistic regression model.

```python
from src.train import train_model
from src.evaluate import evaluate_model

# Train the model
model, X_test, y_test = train_model()

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```
